    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Markets still remain bullish.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve had mini-liquidation breaks throughout the trading day - all that does is strengthen the market, as it eliminates the shorter-term, weaker hands, allowing buyers to continue doing what they do - buying.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04192016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04192016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-19 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>We had a nice strong close by the end of the trading session.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04192016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04192016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-19 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Also a nice follow through here.</p>

<p>However, the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04192016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04192016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-19 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Still the weakest of the bunch. This is one that casts a shadow of doubt on the rally - eventually, this, or one or more of the other indices will catch up to the other.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04192016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/04192016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-19 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Consolidating after a move higher from yesterday. Watch for a continuation tomorrow. Our <a href="/trades#RUT" title="RUT Call Calendar">RUT calendar</a> is still looking good, and we&rsquo;re holding on to it - no need to panic out.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today. As always, make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a>.

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/18/bias-still-to-the-upside</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Market trucks relentlessly to the upside, and bias remains to the upside until market starts to show signs of sellers.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04182016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04182016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-18 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>We closed just above that trendline, which can now be considered broken. The next target here is 2100, followed by 2115.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04182016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04182016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-18 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Bullish here as well. We closed above the highs of November from last year. The next target would be around 181.9.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04182016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04182016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-18 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>The weakest of the bunch, but it closed at the trendline resistance and has room to run to the upside. First target is the gap fill of 2016, which is just about 20 points away.</p>

<p>Finally the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04182016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/04182016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-18 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>This broke the trendline resistance very cleanly. The next major resistance is around 1200.</p>

<p>Today, we put on the trade discussed yesterday for the RUT - you can see that post <a href="/blog/2016/04/17/remaining-cautiously-bullish/" title="RUT Call Calendar Spread">here</a>. If you missed the entry, it&rsquo;s not too late to get in the trade.

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/17/remaining-cautiously-bullish</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m continuing to remain cautiously bullish going into next week, given the massive overhead resistance we still have.</p>

<p>Looking at the broad market indices on the weekly, here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04172016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04172016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-17 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>We finished last week with a wide body candle after <em>consolidating</em> for a couple of weeks prior. This leads me to believe that, if we do continue moving up, the trendline resistance up ahead is less likely to hold, given how close we consolidated just under that.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04172016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04172016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-17 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>The previous trendline resistance (now support) is holding up nicely. The same thing can be seen here - consolidation right underneath the 100% Fib level from back in November. This makes me think it&rsquo;s not hard to pierce that resistance level.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04172016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04172016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-17 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Again, same thing.</p>

<p>The RUT probably paints the clearest picture:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04172016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/04172016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-17 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve consolidated over the past two weeks below the trendline and closed the week right up against it. That trendline can easily be invalidated, in which case we&rsquo;d have clearance to run up to the 1200 levels again.</p>

<p>Given what we just saw in the RUT, come Monday I&rsquo;m looking to put on a Call Calendar (again?!) in the RUT (unfortunately, the market has been extremely boring recently, and this is one of the bread and butter strategies during times of low volatility):</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04172016/rut_call_calendar.png"><img src="/images/blog/04172016/rut_call_calendar.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-17 - Call Calendar" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll manage this over the next month. The debit here is quite small for the potential gains we can achieve. If you have a bearish portfolio, this could be quite beneficial if the market does continue running higher.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this weekend. I&rsquo;ll be posting that trade, along with all other entries/adjustments, live on Twitter, so be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a> to get all of my updates in real time.</p>

<p>Good luck in the markets this week!</p>

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/06/more-consolidation/"/>

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/06/more-consolidation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Market continues to consolidate here. As I mentioned yesterday, I just didn&rsquo;t see enough sellers, and that spells low confidence.</p>

<p>Looking at the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04062016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04062016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-06 - Daily - Look-Above-And-Fail" /></a></p>

<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s look-above-and-fail pattern failed, and now we&rsquo;re back up above the trendline support. All of this just spells low confidence.</p>

<p>DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04062016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04062016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-06 - Daily - Bounced off Trendline Support" /></a></p>

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t continue lower after testing the support. Once again, consolidating just above the trendline support.</p>

<p>NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04062016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04062016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-06 - Daily - Seller Shutoff" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re still consolidating here, though we have a wide body candle.</p>

<p>RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04062016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/04062016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-06 - Daily - Bullish Engulfing" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re now back up above the 61.8% Fib level - again, this spells low confidence. When a price level is traded through many times, it&rsquo;s not a sign of trend confidence, but rather a sign of consolidation, or low confidence.</p>

<p>Today, we put on a couple of new trades, specifically calendar spreads in CMG and EEM. We also made some adjustments to our TSLA position (currently our worst trade so far) and closed out our AAPL calendar (at a profit). Check them out in the <a href="/trades" title="Ongoing Trades">Trades</a> page.

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today. Good luck in the markets tomorrow!</p>

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/05/market-still-pausing/"/>
    <updated>2016-04-05T21:23:05-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/05/market-still-pausing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There isn&rsquo;t a lot pointing to the Bears being in full control, yet. For now, it still appears to just be consolidation. I am still watching for a break below 2033.5 on the /ES with strong follow-through before I turn bearish.</p>

<p>Looking at the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04052016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04052016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-05 - Daily - Look-Above-And-Fail" /></a></p>

<p>Today it appears we formed a look-above-and-fail pattern - I&rsquo;d like to see follow-through to the downside for confirmation.</p>

<p>DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04052016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04052016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-05 - Daily - Sitting at Trendline Support" /></a></p>

<p>We closed just at trendline support. Let&rsquo;s see if it holds.</p>

<p>NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04052016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04052016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-05 - Daily - Consolidation" /></a></p>

<p>This appears to just be consolidating over the past 5 trading days.</p>

<p>RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04052016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/04052016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-05 - Daily - Consolidation" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re now below the 61.8% Fib level. We&rsquo;ve now traded near and around the 61.8% Fib level many times - consolidation is still happening here.</p>

<p>Ok - we haven&rsquo;t been putting on many trades this week. This is largely due to my reluctance to sell premium in a cycle that contains earnings, but I&rsquo;ve managed to find some that avoid it with good weeklies.</p>

<p>I wanted to go back to GS which I mentioned the other day:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04032016/gs_batman.png"><img src="/images/blog/04032016/gs_batman.png" alt="GS - 2016-04-05 - Put Backratio With Call Backratio" /></a></p>

<p>Though this play contains an earnings cycle, I&rsquo;ve noticed that it doesn&rsquo;t quite move much from earnings reports. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind putting this on tomorrow - with pretty wide breakevens, we can aim for a move towards both ends of the spectrum, regardless of which way the market moves. Just as long as it doesn&rsquo;t crash, of course. This is currently being priced in at a .67 cr.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also got a couple of calendars/diagonals for play here.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s DIS:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04052016/dis.png"><img src="/images/blog/04052016/dis.png" alt="DIS - 2016-04-05 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>Aiming for 90 by the 4th week of April:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04052016/dis_diagonal.png"><img src="/images/blog/04052016/dis_diagonal.png" alt="DIS - 2016-04-05 - Diagonal Put" /></a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s EEM:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04052016/eem.png"><img src="/images/blog/04052016/eem.png" alt="EEM - 2016-04-05 - Daily" /></a></p>

<p>Aiming for 30 by the 5th week of April:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04052016/eem_calendar.png"><img src="/images/blog/04052016/eem_calendar.png" alt="EEM - 2016-04-05 - Put Calendar" /></a></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s CMG:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04052016/cmg.png"><img src="/images/blog/04052016/cmg.png" alt="CMG - 2016-04-05 - Daily - Slow Grind to 420" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking for a slow grind down to 420:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04052016/cmg_calendar.png"><img src="/images/blog/04052016/cmg_calendar.png" alt="CMG - 2016-04-05 - Put Calendar" /></a></p>

<p>All of these require a debit, but when volatility is low, these are good deals. If we get the directional move we want and volatility expands and time decays the nearer-term option, the spread can really expand nicely.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. I&rsquo;ll most likely be putting these trades on, so <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a> to get my updates. Also, to make the most out of Twitter, make sure you turn on notifications specifically from me. Just visit my Twitter profile on mobile, select the Settings gear, and turn on notifications.</p>

<p>Good luck in the markets tomorrow!</p>
