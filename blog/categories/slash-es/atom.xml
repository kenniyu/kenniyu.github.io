    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s liquidation was one which I haven&rsquo;t seen in a while and showed some signs of life from the sellers.</p>

<p>Whether or not Icahn contributed to the scare doesn&rsquo;t matter. Here&rsquo;s the current volume profile over the past 15 days:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04292016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/04292016/es.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-29 - 15d Chart - Volume Profile" /></a></p>

<p>By the end of the session, we managed to trade back inside the intermediate balance area. Though traders got themselves stretched too short to the downside, notice that they did so with volume and were able to form two distributions (highlighted by the pink boxes):</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04292016/es_zoomed.png"><img src="/images/blog/04292016/es_zoomed.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-29 - 5d Chart - Volume Profile" /></a></p>

<p>The profile shows that the trades that occurred at the bottom distribution happened with decent volume, almost as much as there was in the upper distribution. This is definitely an edge to the Bears. However, notice that the volume POC did not migrate lower - it remained at 2087.5 - and most of the time was spent trading up there as well.</p>

<p>Today, I want to see if the POC and value area can migrate lower. I&rsquo;d like to see some continuation of selling from the Bears before switching my bias. For now, however, the Bulls have some work to do as well, and that is to get trading back above the intermediate balance area to at least in the upper distribution. Until then, my bias is neutral.</p>

<p>Also, let&rsquo;s quickly take a look at the major market indices.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04292016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04292016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-04-29 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve now fallen back below that trendline which we&rsquo;ve meandered back and forth between. Let&rsquo;s see if the Bears can hold it below here and show some continuation to the downside.</p>

<p>The DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04292016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04292016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-04-29 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re now below the highs of Nov 2015. Looks like the Bulls failed to keep it above there for now.</p>

<p>The NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04292016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/04292016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-04-29 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>That trendline resistance has played out well, and this is still the weakest of the bunch. We&rsquo;re now below that 61.8% Fib retracement, closing yesterday&rsquo;s trade below it on a wide body candle.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the RUT:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04292016/rut.png"><img src="/images/blog/04292016/rut.png" alt="RUT - 2016-04-29 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Still holding above the trendline support quite well. We&rsquo;ll need to see if this one will start rolling over.</p>

<p>Keep a close eye on all of these indices, and let&rsquo;s see who wins the struggle up here.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today&rsquo;s morning market outlook.

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/28/fairest-price-to-do-business</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Taking a look at the volume profile:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04282016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/04282016/es.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-28 - 15m Chart - Volume Profile" /></a></p>

<p>Yesterday, although we ripped higher into the end, value was still mostly unchanged, with the POC hovering near 2083.5. Again, this is practically where the POC has been on Tuesday, last Friday, last Thursday, and last Monday. Regardless of trendlines and such, the transactions shown by the profile tell us that this area is the fairest price to do business.</p>

<p>Currently, /ES is trading at 2078, 13 points from yesterday&rsquo;s settle. I would like to see if value can migrate lower back into the intermediate balance area denoted by the range between 2067 and 2081.75. Will the POC develop near this Monday&rsquo;s POC? To give any edge to the Bears, we need to move value area back into this intermediate balance area and take out 2067. Currently, there is just not enough seller strength at all, so my bias remains neutral to bullish.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be looking to see how 2083.5 plays out today. On the open, if we climb higher and tag that POC and we manage to continue trading there, then essentially nothing has changed from yesterday. If we tag that POC but fall back down and start developing value lower, that&rsquo;s an edge to the Bears. But again, that&rsquo;s if sellers step up.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today&rsquo;s morning market outlook. I&rsquo;ll be looking to put on more trades today as I haven&rsquo;t done much of it this week.

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/27/trading-near-prominent-point-of-control/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good morning traders.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/blog/2016/04/25/watch-for-an-upside-move/" title="Watch for an Upside Move">last post</a>, we discussed how trading near the POC from last Monday, Thursday, or Friday is very possible. We got exactly that yesterday, with another rip higher into the close as traders found themselves unable to take the market lower:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04272016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/04272016/es.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-27 - 15m Chart - Volume Profile" /></a></p>

<p>Notice how we developed most of yesterday&rsquo;s value above 2081.75. Bias here should be neutral to slightly bullish.</p>

<p>The overnight inventory on the /ES is currently net short. We&rsquo;re currently trading around yesterday&rsquo;s POC at around <strong>2082.50</strong>, with the overnight low at <strong>2080.75</strong>:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04272016/es_reference_points.png"><img src="/images/blog/04272016/es_reference_points.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-27 - 5m Chart - Reference Points" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be looking to see how the overnight low holds - if we break below it but are unable to find more sellers and we begin trading back above it and then through the open, I&rsquo;ll be looking to target yesterday&rsquo;s value area high at <strong>2086.50</strong>, then the overnight high at <strong>2087</strong>, followed by yesterday&rsquo;s settle, which is <strong>2088.75</strong>. Again, watch for internals to confirm.</p>

<p>As for downside references, my opinion remains the same as yesterday&rsquo;s post:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I would need to see the 2067 level fail. If we close below there with signs of stronger selling, I&rsquo;ll be looking to target the other side of balance, which is down at 2012. More intermediate targets would occur along the way, but they&rsquo;ll be noted when we do break 2067.&rdquo;</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Value continues to build lower:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04242016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/04252016/es.png" alt="/ESM6 - 2016-04-25 - 15m Chart - Volume Profile" /></a></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s definitely not a bullish sign; however, just to stay alert, I wanted to point out one thing that I noticed over the past two trading sessions that has me prepared for a move back to the upside, and this is the way in which the Bears have attempted to push prices lower. You may have noticed the slow and steady grind lower during Friday&rsquo;s action and today&rsquo;s action. This has me thinking that the Bears aren&rsquo;t really confident, and they&rsquo;re struggling to push prices lower, but ultimately unable to. You can see this clearly during the past two trading sessions, where much of the grind lower gets wiped out by a big rip to the upside towards the end of each session.</p>

<p>Also, notice that today, we managed to close above the intermediate balance area high. I would not be surprised tomorrow if we hold above that level and trade near the POC from last Monday, Thursday, or Friday, which is around 2085. If so, I would consider that bullish, and would be looking to put on some type of a credit trade that captures a move into the 2100 level going forward.</p>

<p>For me to switch my bias to bearish, I would need to see the 2067 level fail. If we close below there with signs of stronger selling, I&rsquo;ll be looking to target the other side of balance, which is down at 2012. More intermediate targets would occur along the way, but they&rsquo;ll be noted when we do break 2067.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today. For now, I&rsquo;m still keeping my bias neutral, but watching for any bullish/bearish signals.</p>

    <link href="http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/21/will-the-bears-continue-the-selling-pressure/"/>
    <updated>2016-04-21T18:49:01-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/04/21/will-the-bears-continue-the-selling-pressure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We saw a nice liquidation break today, and actually saw the first sign of sellers being able to keep that pressure on throughout the entire RTH session. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the overall volume profile over the past 20 days:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04212016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/04212016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-04-21 - Volume Profile - 20 days" /></a></p>

<p>We can see that today, not only did we clearly create value lower, but also look where the point of control migrated to: basically back to where it was on Monday. We&rsquo;re now exploring this area to see if this is the fairest price to do business.</p>

<p>And if we zoom in and take a closer look at the past couple of weeks:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04212016/es_zoomed.png"><img src="/images/blog/04212016/es_zoomed.png" alt="/ES - 2016-04-21 - Volume Profile - Zoomed In - Value Area Gapping Lower" /></a></p>

<p>Notice today, our value area not only migrated lower, but also it did not overlap yesterday&rsquo;s value area. When value areas gap like this, it <em>generally</em> signifies the start of a new trend (although a larger gap would&rsquo;ve been better to signify stronger selling pressure). Will the selling continue tomorrow? We can only wait to find out, but until then, bias is neutral.</p>

<p>Going forward, here are important reference points to keep in mind: I&rsquo;ll be watching how the <strong>2081.75</strong> level holds tomorrow. <strong>The area between 2067 and 2081.75 can be considered a balance area</strong>, which was formed last week for a few days before we broke higher out of it this Monday. If we fall back into this area tomorrow and we start seeing some really strong selling pressure (watch the internals), look to target the other side of that balance area, which is <strong>2067</strong>.</p>

<p>Before wrapping up, I&rsquo;d like to propose a trade idea, which I haven&rsquo;t in a while. Here&rsquo;s <strong>HAL</strong> on the daily:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04212016/hal.png"><img src="/images/blog/04212016/hal.png" alt="HAL - 2016-04-21 - Daily Chart" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking to position a trade around <strong>HAL</strong> that assumes the analog of what happened last year would happen again this year. If so, a trade that captures a slow retracement to the bottom of the right orange rectangle over the next month or so would probably be ideal.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any butterflies/put backratios that were great, so I was thinking a small calendar play may work here, specifically, the JUN/MAY 36 PUT calendar:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/04212016/hal_calendar.png"><img src="/images/blog/04212016/hal_calendar.png" alt="HAL - 2016-04-21 - Put Calendar" /></a></p>

<p>This is a much longer-term play, and we&rsquo;ll need to wait probably around a month or so for the premium to really start coming in. If you have a slight bearish bias on the energy sector, this could be the play for you.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that this company does have earnings coming up, but I&rsquo;m not really expecting the stock to move much to the downside, and we have quite some time for the trade to work out for us. I&rsquo;ll be looking to put this trade on tomorrow, so be on the lookout for that.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today - as always, make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a>. That is where I post all of my trades in real-time. Make sure you turn on notifications specifically from me.

<p>Good luck in the markets tomorrow, and remember to keep those reference points in mind on the /ES.</p>
