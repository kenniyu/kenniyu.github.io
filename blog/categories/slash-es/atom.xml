    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last Friday we formed two distributions:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05092016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/05092016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-05-09 - 5m Chart - Volume Profile" /></a></p>

<p>Traders took the market back up to the upper distribution formed on Thursday.</p>

<p>Overall, the market last week moved lower, but did so with a bit of a forced action. Ultimately traders found themselves unable to take the market much lower in multiple sessions, and by the end of these sessions, we saw an end of the day rally. Furthermore, value areas were mostly overlapping throughout last week, meaning it seemed hard for the Bears to get any sort of momentum to the downside or a trend going at all. All of this spells low confidence to me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m remaining neutral going into this week until things change. For downside targets, I&rsquo;ll be watching last week&rsquo;s RTH low at 2033.75 and overnight low at 2030.50 to see how those hold. For upside targets, we have high volume nodes at around 2075 and 2085. If we have any sort of a rally, I&rsquo;ll be looking to put on a trade that captures a move into those areas, for a credit.</p>

<p>Here is a brief look at the major market indices on the weekly.</p>

<p>SPX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05092016/spx.png"><img src="/images/blog/05092016/spx.png" alt="SPX - 2016-05-09 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Still holding below trendline resistance, and has room to fall to the downside to the 38% Fib.</p>

<p>DJX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05092016/djx.png"><img src="/images/blog/05092016/djx.png" alt="DJX - 2016-05-09 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>This one is holding well above the trendline support.</p>

<p>NDX:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05092016/ndx.png"><img src="/images/blog/05092016/ndx.png" alt="NDX - 2016-05-09 - Weekly Chart" /></a></p>

<p>As the weakest of the bunch, it&rsquo;s spent a long time grinding lower and is holding above the 50% Fib.</p>

<p>RUT:</p>

<p>Just closed below the trendline resistance last week. Let&rsquo;s see how that trendline acts as resistance this week, however.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this weekend/morning market outlook. We&rsquo;ll be doing more trade adjustments today, so as always, make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me there</a> to receive tweets about our trades in real-time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We formed two distributions yesterday, with the POC at 2049.25. Although we slowly took trade to the lower distribution of yesterday&rsquo;s trade, value was overlapping to up - not something I would point to as extremely bearish:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05062016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/05062016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-05-06 - 15m Chart - Volume Profile" /></a></p>

<p>Currently, /ES is gapping down about 5 points. As mentioned in previous blog posts, the Bears still have a lot to chew through to get well past the 2040.50 level. The unemployment numbers coming out today could be the deciding factor of whether or not we move up or down. Watch the internals and look for selling backed by volume. If we do head lower, look for a slight bounce at 2032.75. If that doesn&rsquo;t hold, 2012 is that next target:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Value gapped lower yesterday and traders found themselves accepting prices just slightly above the high volume node  at 2040.50. As mentioned before, the Bears have a lot to chew through in order to break through the downside, and that is the entire balance area that we see on the left:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05052016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/05052016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-05-05 - 1hr Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Currently futures are gapping up about 7.50, right inside Tuesday&rsquo;s value area and near its POC. Will traders find acceptance again back in this area? If so, we would&rsquo;ve had 3 days of overlapping value area (last Friday, this Tuesday, and then today if it happens), and it marks this area as an important short-term balance area.</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05052016/es_zoomed.png"><img src="/images/blog/05052016/es_zoomed.png" alt="/ES - 2016-05-05 - 5m Chart" /></a></p>

<p>Reference points for today are 2060 (overnight high), 2053.50 (yesterday&rsquo;s high), 2047.50 (yesterday&rsquo;s value area high), 2045.50 (yesterday&rsquo;s POC) and 2041.25 (yesterday&rsquo;s value area low). Watch how the overnight high acts as a reference point: if we rally up to there, but fail to take it out or only take it out by a tick or two and then fail back down, you can look to target yesterday&rsquo;s high back down at 2053.50, followed by the value area high, then the POC, then value area low, and then yesterday&rsquo;s low.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today&rsquo;s market outlook. Yesterday we managed some positions and opened up new trades. Today, we&rsquo;ll be looking to book some winners if we can exit with 50% profitability.

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/05/04/about-that-high-volume-node</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations to the Bears. Yesterday&rsquo;s action proved that Monday was nothing more than a fake-out, with the value overlapping Friday&rsquo;s value area. It appears that we&rsquo;re now going to explore the big balance area that we&rsquo;ve had going back from mid-March to mid-April - this is the 2012 to 2067 area:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05042016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/05042016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-05-04 - 1hr Chart" /></a></p>

<p><a href="www.thetatrades.com/blog/2016/04/30/an-edge-to-the-bears/" title="An Edge to the Bears">As I mentioned multiple times in previous posts</a>, the first target to the downside is 2040.50 - this is where that high volume node sits on the volume composite. Expect any movement to the downside be halted by that area, because that is where a lot of transactions occurred, and traders will most likely be stepping up to buy there (by the way, if you look at the overnight data, look where we stopped - 2040.75 just one tick above that high volume node). If sellers start taking control after that point, then look to target the other side of balance, which is 2012 (again, this is why I&rsquo;ve been having these reference points on the chart for so long, so I can carry this information forward for days like today).</p>

<p>For today, just focus on 2040.50 and how traders accept that high volume node. Currently, the /ES is gapping down about 11.50 points as of the time of this writing. Upside reference points are yesterday&rsquo;s low at 2048, yesterday&rsquo;s value area low at 2051.50, and yesterday&rsquo;s POC at 2055.50. Keep these points in mind for upside targets today. If internals lift, these are potential targets, one after the other.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for the morning market outlook.

    <id>http://kenniyu.github.io/blog/2016/05/03/mind-the-pocs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We formed two distributions yesterday:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05032016/es.png"><img src="/images/blog/05032016/es.png" alt="/ES - 2016-05-03 - 15m Chart" /></a></p>

<p>We closed yesterday&rsquo;s trade in the upper distribution, which resides back in the intermediate balance area. The Bulls were able to get trade back up into the lower distribution from last Thursday&rsquo;s trade. I&rsquo;m not surprised at all - as I mentioned before, I think the trading we continue to see from both the Bulls and Bears is one of low confidence.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look on the 5-minute chart:</p>

<p><a href="/images/blog/05032016/es_zoomed.png"><img src="/images/blog/05032016/es_zoomed.png" alt="/ES - 2016-05-03 - 5m Chart Taking a Closer Look at POCs and Distributions" /></a></p>

<p>As of now, the /ES is gapping down about 12 points. This is inside yesterday&rsquo;s lower distribution. I want to see how traders acknowledge yesterday&rsquo;s POC at around 2065.75. Do we continue to trade near this POC in this lower distribution, or will traders like the upper distribution more? The former gives me a neutral bias, while the latter gives me more of a bullish bias. A healthy move to the downside would be to gap below yesterday&rsquo;s POC, retrace back up to tag it, and then sell off. Watch for this to happen, as this is a bearish sign. Furthermore, keep in mind Friday&rsquo;s POC at around 2058.50. Ignoring overnight data, this POC is currently untouched. Taking trade lower to that point today is also a bearish sign - watch how traders accept this POC as well.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for today&rsquo;s morning market outlook. Hope you caught some of my trades yesterday - I&rsquo;ll be looking to put on more trades today, so make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/theta_positive" title="Follow @thetatrades on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a>, as that&rsquo;s where I post all of my trade entries/adjustments/exits as they come.</p>
